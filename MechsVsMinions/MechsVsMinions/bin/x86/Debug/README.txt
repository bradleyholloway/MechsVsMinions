Welcome to MechsVsMinion v0.0.0.0.0.1 (pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha)
Thank you for helping me test, and please send feeback to bradley@holloway.fyi.

This document is to try to help you understand how to play this "non-game".

Each Player (only single player for now) has a Mech. This is your character that you
control throughout the game. The way you control this mech is by adjusting your Command Line.
Your Command Line is a series of 6 slots for your mech that house stacks of Command Cards.

There are 3 Phases to the Player Turn.

 1) Drafting Command Cards
	5 Command Cards are drawn from the deck and the player chooses 4 of them.
	(This becomes more involved when multiplayer is added)

 2) With the 4 cards you selected, you now choose which slot to place each of them in.
	Cards can be placed ontop of other cards. This "overwrites" the effect. If a stack of 
	cards has the same color, the effect increases to each additional level (up to 3).
	For example: IF I had two blue cards in a slot, I would use the second abillity level
	of the card on top when this slot is executed.

 3) Activation
	You mech turns on and the entire command line is executed from start to finish. Some cards
	may offer a player choice (such as turn left or right), while others will not.

	... I give up. Just watch someone else actually explain it.
